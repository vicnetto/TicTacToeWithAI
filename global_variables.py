# A list of all global variables used in the project, to make the variables
# more usable again.

ROW = 2
# ROW -> type: int
#    The purpose of this global variable is to define where is
#    exactly the first number of the input. In another words, it is
#    basically the place in the input string that is possible to
#    find the row number.

COLUMN = 0
# COLUMN -> type: int
#    This global variable makes almost the same thing of the ROW
#    variable, but in another place in the string. In the same way,
#    this number have the position of the second input number on
#    the string.

PLAYER = 0
# PLAYER -> type: int
#    Now we have some variables that define the level/mode of the
#    game. The first one is "BASIC". This mode is made to play
#    with friends, that is why it is not possible to find any kind
#    of IA in this mode.

EASY = 1
# EASY -> type: int
#    In this mode, starts the basic IA. Of course this is not even
#    considered an IA. This mode is just the computer making random
#    moves to the board, in other words the "IA" actually doesn't
#    know what she is doing.

NORMAL = 2

EXPERT = 3
